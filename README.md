# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project description:
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using the Sentiment140 dataset, which consists of 1.6 million tweets extracted using the Twitter API. The tweets in this dataset have been annotated as either negative or positive sentiment based on their content. The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify the sentiment of a tweet as either positive or negative.

The dataset consists of six fields: target, ids, date, flag, user, and text. The target field contains the polarity of the tweet, with 0 representing negative sentiment, 2 representing neutral sentiment, and 4 representing positive sentiment. The ids field contains the unique identifier for each tweet, while the date field indicates when the tweet was posted. The flag field contains the query used to extract the tweet, and the user field contains the username of the Twitter user who posted the tweet. Finally, the text field contains the actual text content of the tweet.

In this project, we will use machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to train a model on the Sentiment140 dataset. We will preprocess the data by performing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal to ensure that the text data is in a format suitable for machine learning models. We will then use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the model.

The end goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify the sentiment of a tweet as either positive or negative. The model can be used to analyze the sentiment of Twitter data for various applications, such as brand monitoring and customer feedback analysis.
